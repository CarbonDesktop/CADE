# CADE Contributors Guide

This is a little guide which should tell people how they can contribute to the developement of
CADE. First, everyone can contribute :+1:. We are happy over everyone who wants to support us,
so if you want to contribute, **THANK YOU**! :tada:

## How can you contribute

You can contribute in many different ways: If you are a programmer, you can submit pull requests
and help us to write code. Furthermore everyone can search for bugs (even by simply using CADE :smile:).
If you found one, please open an issue in our [bugtracker](https://www.github.com/CarbonDesktop/CADE/issues).

You can also improve translations, documentation and other stuff not related to code.

Also, if you are an artist and you want to help us with some design work, please open a new issue to tell
us what you could do!

### Pull Requests

If you want to submit a PR (Pull Request) you have to make sure that your code follows our
(simple) requirements. All conditions can be seen after you create a PR.

All PR's must be related to an issue. If you want to implement some feature, open an issue so that
other can see who is doing what and why.

### Opening Issues

To open an issue, you should check if there is allready an issue with the same intention, if not, go on
and open a new one.

The only thing that could be tricky for new linux users is that you need to submit system information called
`uname -a`. You can get this by simply opening a terminal and calling `uname -a` and copy the output.

# Once Again: **THANK YOU!**
